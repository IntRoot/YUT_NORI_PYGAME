# PYGAME

Basic Rules:

Run away from the tigers and reach the end of the game board before the tiger. PRESS SPACE KEY to roll Yuts (the tokens will move automatically). After your move, it is the tiger’s turn to hunt you. 

The user’s piece will be caught if it is at the new site of one tiger’s piece, and the user will lose the game; if the tiger’s piece is at the new site of one user’s piece, the user will have one more chance to throw Yut.

Yut sticks

DO : Move 1 space

Ge : Move 2 spaces

Geol : Move 3 spaces

Yut : Move 4 spaces and have a chance to throw again

Mo: Move 5 paces and have a chance to throw again

1) If the pawn begins its move on one of the corner spaces or the center space, it can take a shortcut.

2) At each corner of the boards, the player is given choices based on the scenario of their card. They chose the path by clicking the button. There is a consequence to their decision.

Changes from the original plan: horror theme is more focused on the tiger. Due to the time limit, I could not draw all the art for the cards and create a scenario for each card, but [card.py](http://card.py/) shows the ideas of how I was going to implement feature 2.
